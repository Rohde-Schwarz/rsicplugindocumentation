7. Function Panel - SCPI Tree
==============================

SCPI Tree is a tab of the Instrument Function Panel allowing you to access all the instrument's supported SCPI commands.

.. image:: images/FunctionPanel_ScpiTree-func_panel_scpi_tree.drawio.png

Description of the controls:

1. **Function Panel SCPI Tree Tab** - select this tab to access SCPI Tree features.
2. **Read Tree from Instrument** - button, that requires active connection (see SCPI Communicator). Use it to read the SCPI Tree from the instrument. You only need to do it once. After that, the SCPI Tree is cached in your computer.
3. **Filter Controls** - Filter Toggle button switches the filtering of the tree ON/OFF. Filtering uses a powerful SCPI-syntax tailored engine to filter commands you are searching for. See the control's tooltip for more details on the syntax.
4. **Search Controls** - Search button and the Search Text allow for searching of next element fulfilling the search text. The syntax is the same as for the Filter Control.
5. **Select SCPI Group** - optional list-box, only visible when your instrument supports reading of the SCPI commands per Firmware Application (Group).
6. **Expand/Collapse all Tree Branches** - expands or collapses all the SCPI Tree branches. Use the context-menu to expand/collapse only certain branch, or certain level.
7. **Flat Tree Toggle (F2)** - toggle the display between tree and flat list.
8. **Foldable Settings Panel** - open pupup window with settings related to look-and-feel of the SCPI Tree branches and commands.

7.1 Reading the SCPI Tree
""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Once you read the instrument's SCPI Tree, you can use all the features related to SCPI auto-completion and SCPI search operations. You only have to do this once. After that, the SCPI Tree is chached in your computer. Keep in mind, that the cached tree is related to a specific instrument's firmware version. After a firmware update, you need to read it again.

Follow the operations in order shown on the picture below:

	1. **Connect** to your instrument
	2. **Select** the SCPI Tree Function Panel tab
	3. **Read** the SCPI Tree from the instrument

Each SCPI Tree item has a dedicated menu with many useful actions. Example for a single SCPI Command node:

.. tip::

    Check the tooltip texts for the Filter and Search text fields, they show syntax and examples for the match expressions:
    The filter/search text is a combination of space-separated tokens with logical AND between them:

        - Search for a SCPI part that must follow in this very order: ``CONF:FREQ``
        - Search for SCPI parts regardless of the order: ``CONF FREQ``
        - Search for SCPI parts, anchored at the beginning and at the end: ``:CONF FREQ;``
        - Search for a parameter: ``P>EXT``
        - Search for a SCPI with a parameter: ``ROSCillator P>EXT``
        - Search full text: ``F>quency``

.. tip::
    
    Use drag&drop on the SCPI Tree Command nodes to paste write or query snippets to your Python script. The drag&drop also works for SCPI editors.
